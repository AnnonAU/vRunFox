This is a utility to create a runtime Command Window, and works pretty much
like the native VFP Command Window, except that it doesn't require the
development version of VFP to work. It gives you all of the power of the
native FoxPro Command Window in a distributed app.

This version of vRunFox contains a hook that will allow you to add login
capabilities to the program, preventing unauthorized people from accessing
the power inherent in a full command window.

If there is a file named 'vRunFoxLogin.fxp' in the same directory as the
vRunFox executable, it will call that fxp and use the return value to
determine if they should be allowed to run the program or not. In other
words, you can create whatever sort of login procedure you like and call it
from the vRunFoxLogin program; as long as vRunFoxLogin returns .T., the user
will be able to use vRunFox. If it returns .F., vRunFox will simply exit.

NOTE: I am not supporting vRunFox any more. I have not used Visual FoxPro in
several years, and do not intend on using it anytime soon. I am releasing the
code under the BSD open source license so that anyone who still has an interest
in this is free to update the code as their needs dictate. See the LICENSE file
in the root of this distribution for specific license details.
